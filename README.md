## 1. System Requiremnt 
The R codes in this project is developed using MAC OS. The coding involves correction of encoding problems, and therefore only able to run on MAC OS systems. For Windows users, use the link or amend the source code in the section *Remove the multiple bytes values*.

## 2. User Guide
1. Click the symbols on the map, basic information of the attack will be shown. 
2. To study extreme events, click the point on the scatter, details will be printed. 
For more explanation, refer to the user guide in the report.

## 3. Link
The application is deployed using shinyapps.io by RStudio. Click [Here](https://cfon0004.shinyapps.io/visualization_project/) to check out the app. 

## 4. Database and Copy Right:
Before running the code, please download the [datafile](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd#globalterrorismdb_0617dist.csv) (Source from Kaggle) to the same directory as the app.R.

This system uses Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2016. GTD reserves all usage rights of this dataset. Refer to Term of Use .
